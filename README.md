# Networks Client-Server Simulation

This project was developed as part of a group assignment for a college course in **Computer Networks**.

## Overview

The objective was to simulate a complete client-server interaction. The system is designed to:

- Accept an input file of any size
- Break the file into smaller packets
- Transmit the packets from the client to the server
- Reconstruct the original file on the server side
- Verify file integrity using a checksum

This simulation models fundamental concepts of reliable data transfer in networked systems.
